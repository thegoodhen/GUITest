# TGH GUI
This will be an 8266 Arduino library for web GUI. The work in progress is already the richest-featured GUI library for 8266 that I know of.

It supports checkboxes, text inputs, multi-line text inputs, sliders, buttons and labels and I will soon implement tabs, list boxes and perhaps even charts.

The elements can be organised to some extent (vBoxes, hBoxes, expandables are coming).
